# React Board Game Reviews Site

This repo contains a frontend solo project completed during the Northcoders software development bootcamp. The project is a board game reviews website built in React. Users can view reviews, comment on reviews, vote on reviews and more. The React app makes use of an API I built using Express, Node.js and PSQL in the backend section of the course.
